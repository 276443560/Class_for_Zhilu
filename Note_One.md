# Note for Class One
## The difference between *algorithm* and *model*
1. Model is more about mathematics
   - The model is more like a ***<font color=Blue>mathematical theoretical</font>*** methods for machine learning or other algorithm.
   - Name deep learning as an expample, the physical neural network and the loss function are the mathematical bases of its problem-solving ability.
   - Regression model used for data fittingã€‚
   - Tree model is a classical classification model.
3. Algrithm is more about computer realization
   - When you have a math model for your codes, you need to realize it in your computer and coding by a language that computers can understand.
   - Model is the final aim of your code, while the algrithm is the pathway for the aim realization.
   - The algorithm determines the **time complexity** and **space complexity** of the program, this is always nothing to do with your math model.
## Other Crucial Note for the First Class
1. Introduction to bioinformatics.
   - There are two main tasks for bioinformatics, the first is the sequence management, while the second one is image recognition.
   - **Sequence management** needs powerful algorithm and CPU resource to finish, while the **image recognition** is more about machine learning, especially in deep learning in this recent decade.
   - In this class, we will mainly learn the processing methods for NGS data analysis.
2. The crucial position of bioinfomatics/genetics in science.
   - ***Science*** magzine lists 120 crucial science questions in 2005, the first five are listed below:
> 1. What Is the Universe Made Of?
> 2. What Is the Biological Basis of Consciousness?
> 3. Why Do Humans Have So Few Genes?
> 4. To What Extent Are Genetic Variation and Personal Health Linked?
> 5.Can the Laws of Physics Be Unified?
   - The third question is nearly finished. If the term "gene" termed as mRNA coding DNA, the human genes are few. However, gene is actually DNA that codes imformation, rahter than only codes mRNA.
   - Percent of Genome Not Coding for Protein. Human is the highest creature.
   - The third question is on our way. The famous gene candidates are TP53 and KRAS, yet the genome-wide landscape is largely unknown.
3. Find your position in one team.
   - Nobody can master all the knowledge in bioinformatics, but you need take your advantage to help your team.
