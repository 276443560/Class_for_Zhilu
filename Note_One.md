# Note for Class One
## The difference between *algorithm* and *model*
1. Model is more about mathematics
   - The model is more like a ***<font color=Blue>mathematical theoretical</font>*** methods for machine learning or other algorithm.
   - Name deep learning as an expample, the physical neural network and the loss function are the mathematical bases of its problem-solving ability.
   - Regression model used for data fittingã€‚
   - Tree model is a classical classification model.
3. Algrithm is more about computer realization
   - When you have a math model for your codes, you need to realize it in your computer and coding by a language that computers can understand.
   - Model is the final aim of your code, while the algrithm is the pathway for the aim realization.
   - The algorithm determines the **time complexity** and **space complexity** of the program, this is always nothing to do with your math model.
